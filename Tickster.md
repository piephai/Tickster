The purpose of Tickster is to help people automate their trading allowing them to not be constantly glued to their phone and focus more on their everyday lives. 

Tickster does this by using something called quantitative trading. The current Tickster build is done in Python however, it will be built using the React, Node, Express and MongoDB or PostgresQL
